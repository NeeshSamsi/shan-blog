# Inquisit

A collaborative blog project about igniting curiosity and exploring diverse academic adventures. Aims to deliver value as a source of inspiration and a platform for showcasing your own interdisciplinary pursuits.

## Writing for Inquisit

> If you're not already a collaborator, get in touch and we'll figure something out
>
> Once you are added as a GitHub Collaborator to this repo

### Getting Started

- Navigate to the Inquisit Content Management System at [inquisit.blog/keystatic](https://inquisit.blog/keystatic)

  Shoutout to [Keystatic](https://github.com/thinkmill/keystatic) - An amazing opensource CMS that works completely with local files and GitHub without a standalone database

- You should be greeted with the Dashboard where you have access to view and edit all the Posts, Categories, Authors, etc.

### Writing Articles

- Once you're in the Blog Posts section, you'll see a list of all the posts, both drafts and published.
- Click into a post to edit, or click the Add button at the top right to Create a new one.
- The editor is divided into 3 sections:

  - The left sidebar shows a top level navigation,
  - The centre allows you to edit the actual article &
  - The right bar allows access to editing all the metadata behind the blog such as title, description, categories, authors(s), etc

  You can adjust the sizing of these panels and collapse the sidebar. Bring your mouse to the edge of two panels and you should be able to drag to resize them.

- Similarly, you can add or edit Categories & Authors.

  _(Keystatic doesn't allow granular control of what you can and cannot edit so just don't go around messing with any unnecessary data. Everything is stored on GitHub, documented in the commits and can easily be reverted.)_

### Things to Keep in Mind

_These are unfortunate things that are either not yet features or unable to be features of Keystatic due to how it works. This is the best I can do without using a professional and expensive prebuilt solution or worse, creating a whole content management system from scratch._

- You need to create Categories in the Categories tab before they show up as options inside a Blog Post's select field.
- To Create or Save a post, all the fields need to be filled with something. In a draft, feel free to add placeholders but make sure you change them before publishing. _(This validation is required so that there is never a case where these important fields might get skipped and published empty)_
- There is no Auto Save. Please click the Save button on the top right while editing Blog Posts to avoid any loss of progress.
